category: "Redstone Port Types"
intro: |
  - Each port would have a corresponding colored concrete block under it.
  - Locations of the port holes are in (X, Y), in which (1, 1) is the bottom left block on a 16x16 face looking from the side of a chunk. _(Clarification: Port HOLES, not the concrete position)_
  - Some ports are "dangerously incompatible," meaning the port's position overlaps with a different, more prioritized port(s), which can cause issues when next to these ports.

ports:
  - name: BIN
    emoji: üü•
    color: red
    madeBy: Daxis1
    status: Compliant
    location: "iBIN at (7, 2) - oBIN at (10, 2)"
    description: |
      The default port. Used to connect components together, and is the simplest port
      (as it does not preserve signal strength). These are made for speed.

  - name: HEX
    emoji: üü¶
    color: blue
    madeBy: gingrspacecadet
    status: Compliant
    location: "iHEX at (5, 2) - oHEX at (12, 2)"
    description: |
      A more advanced port. They preserve the signal strength from the output of the previous block.
      Useful for HEX calculations. Recommended to have iHEX next to an iBIN to ensure compatibility.

  - name: HEX-STATE
    emoji: üü©
    color: green
    madeBy: "guigui, Spin4team4096"
    status: Compliant
    location: "iHEX-STATE at (5, 4) - oHEX-STATE at (12, 4)"
    description: |
      (Under development) Used to check the state of a component which is currently doing an operation.
      The component can decide what signal strength each state is. Useful for "observing" component states.

  - name: HEX-2
    emoji: üü®
    color: yellow
    madeBy: LimeLight
    status: Compliant
    location: |
      iHEX-2 at (7, 6) and (9, 6)
      oHEX-2 at (8, 6) and (10, 6)
    description: |
      Just like HEX, but carries double the amount of data, meaning it can carry 8 bits (1 byte) of data!

  - name: BIN-LR
    emoji: üü¶
    color: cyan
    madeBy: Spin4team4096
    status: Compliant
    location: |
      iBIN-LR at (2, 3) for 1st bit, and stack upwards for each additional bit.
      oBIN-LR at (14, 3) similarly stacks upwards.
    description: |
      Useful for computational components, especially since most computational circuits are vertical.

  - name: BIN-8
    emoji: üüß
    color: orange
    madeBy: LimeLight
    status: Semistandard
    location: "Coming soon (never)"
    description: |
      Carries 8 bits of data, but is huge, so a wire can only be one way.
      Useful for speed over long distances of wires, but dangerously incompatible with many other ports.

  - name: SOUND
    emoji: üü™
    color: purple
    madeBy: "BastienA, Xoliks"
    status: Compliant
    location: "iSOUND at (7, 4) - oSOUND at (10, 4)"
    description: |
      A wireless port using sound and sculk sensors to transfer data.

  - name: RAIL
    emoji: üü´
    color: brown
    madeBy: Spin4team4096
    status: Compliant
    location: "iRAIL at (8, 2) - oRAIL at (9, 2)"
    description: |
      The iRAIL is regular rail, and oRAIL is powered rail. Used to transfer items (or mobs/players)
      using minecarts. ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: make sure components use the same type of minecart to avoid mixing.
